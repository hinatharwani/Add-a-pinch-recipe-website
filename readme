Directions
Line a fine-mesh strainer with muslin or cheesecloth and set inside a small bowl. Pour in yogurt; let drain for 15 minutes. Discard liquid.

Mix drained yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, turmeric, chile powder, cumin, garam masala, and salt together in bowl. Add paneer, onion, and green bell pepper and mix well. Marinade for 1 hour.

Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.

Cook's Notes:
Substitute butter for the oil if preferred.

Tikka should ideally be cooked in a charcoal grill for its distinctive smoky flavor. It can, however, be cooked on an electric grill as well, or even in a nonstick skillet.
